WheeStat5_4b_Energia
====================
Wow.  Having a hard time figuring out GitHub.
Anyway, this repository contains the Energia code for the WheeStat5.4.2 potentiostat.  This is a three electrode potentiostat for measuring electrochemical reactions at electrodes in solution.  The potentiostat is appropriate for education and environmental monitoring.  Directions for using the potentiostat are available at http://publiclab.org/wiki/wheestat-user-s-manual.  A number of other resources are available from the PublicLab website by following the links from the above site.
